# Customer-analysis
Using a dataset on consumer info, I clustered the customers based on certain features and created customer profiles for analysis

Files:
* Customer analysis.pdf - Contains a pdf copy of the code I used to cluster the data. This includes data exploration, cleaning, visualization, feature creation, and a clustering algorithm. I also added in some of my own analysis and created a samplpe of potential customer profiles.
* Customer dashboard (1).pbix - Contains a power BI dashboard for visualization and further analysis.
* Customer_pdf.pdf - Contains a pdf copy of the power BI dashboard.
